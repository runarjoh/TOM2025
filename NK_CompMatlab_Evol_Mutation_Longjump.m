    %You have 100 periods and can try one choice configuration
    %in each period. You will then be told the performance of this choice
    %configuration.

    %That segment specifies the choice configuration tested in any
    %given period, t. The choice can depend on the period (t), on n,k,
    %and also on the choices and performance observed so far.
    %Your goal is to find a search strategy that maximizes the average
    %final performance (which will be based on, at least, 100 000 simulations)
    
    %You can change that segment in any way
    %But the choice can only depend on t,n,k,choices and performances
    %t = period

    % performances = performances so far
